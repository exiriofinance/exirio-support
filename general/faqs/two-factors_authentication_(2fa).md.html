(2FA)</h1>
<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to
your Exirio access, and you can choose to enable it (strongly
recommended) in your Settings page. Alternatively, it is also available
if you use one of the <a
href="https://support.exirio.com/en/support/solutions/articles/80000529183">social
login</a> options available (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Apple), and
have enabled 2FA with the social platform of your choice.</p>
