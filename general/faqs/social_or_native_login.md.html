<p>You can choose whether to register/login using one of the social
options (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Apple), or with an email and
password of your choice.</p>
<p>When you opt for a social login we do NOT get any data, other than
your first name, last name, email address and picture. And if you choose
this option, you can avail the extra security of <a

<p>If you opt for one of the social options, you can still access your
account by setting a password for the email associated with the social
account you have used (by clicking on “Forgot password” on the login
page). One exception is for Apple, since Apple gives the users the
ability to mask their email address when using their credentials for
registration or login: if you want to use your Apple account and still
be able to access your Exirio account with your own password, you need
to select the “Share My Email” option in the settings of your iOS
device.</p>
