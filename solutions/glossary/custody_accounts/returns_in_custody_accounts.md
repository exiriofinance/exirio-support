This is because of their cash component, which generates no return (or, in case of leverage, amplifies the securities return).</span></p><p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 200%;">Let’s look at some examples. </span></span></p><ol><li style="font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span dir="ltr" style="line-height: 200%;">In the first scenario, I transfer 100 USD into a broker account on 1 January. On 10 January I buy 50 USD worth of stock X, and my broker charges me 1 USD for the transaction. The only other transaction that occurs in the year is a dividend of 3 USD on 15 April. On 31 December, my stock X is worth 53 USD, and I sell it.  <span style="line-height: 200%;">The MWR of my Broker Account</span> is 5%.</span></span></li><li style="font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span dir="ltr" style="line-height: 200%;">In the second scenario, I buy 50 USD worth of stock X on 10 January, and my broker charges me 1 USD for the transaction. The only other transaction that occurs in the year is a dividend of 3 USD on 15 April. On 31 December, my stock X is worth 53 USD, and I sell it. The MWR of my share Investment is 10.5%.</span></span></li></ol><p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span dir="ltr" style="line-height: 200%;">How is this possible? The answer lies in the cash sitting idle in the broker account, in the first scenario. The return of my investment in stock X is “diluted down” by a <strong>zero return on cash</strong>. The 5% return is calculated on 100 USD, with only half actually invested. The 10.5% return is calculated on 50 USD .</span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 200%;">There is a third scenario, slightly more complicated. </span></span></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span dir="ltr" style="line-height: 200%;">I transfer 100 USD into a broker account on 1 January, but on 10 January I buy 150 USD worth of stock X as my broker agrees to lend me 50 USD. He charges me 1.5 USD to buy stock X and 3 USD upfront to lend me the money. The only other transaction that occurs in the year is a dividend of 9 USD on 15 April (the dividend is 3x as I bought 3 times as many shares). On 31 December, my stock X is worth 159 USD; I sell it and return 50 USD to the broker. The MWR of my broker account (as of 31 December) is 9%. </span></span></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 200%;">This is the <strong>leverage </strong>effect: if the cost of borrowing money is lower than the return I can achieve investing the money I have borrowed, I can amplify the return on my investment. </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 200%;">Leverage is a double-edged sword though, as I need to return 50 USD to the broker no matter what the value of stock X is on 31 December. Leverage amplifies returns in both directions, making my gains larger OR my losses greater, depending on the performance of the investment I have made with the money I borrowed. </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 200%;"> </span></p>
