This is an indirect form of investment, where investors place their assets into a fund and in turn the fund invests in metal. With an exchange-traded fund, equity in the fund is traded on a stock exchange, therefore on Exirio you add it as an ETF (Funds, Brokers & Banks as Asset Class, Security Portfolios as Asset Type).</span></p>
