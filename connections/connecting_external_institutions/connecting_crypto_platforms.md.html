button or the ‘Add Holding’ button, and then “Connect crypto
institution”. Following the on-screen instructions, you will be prompted
to provide your username and password: your credentials are used -
through a 3rd-party provider (Vezgo) - to access and obtain information
from your financial institution in order to provide that information to
Exirio.</p>
<p><strong>Exirio never has access to your login credentials</strong>.
