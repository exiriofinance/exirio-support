# Connecting Crypto platforms

You can connect your Crypto platform to Exirio by selecting the '+' button or the 'Add Holding' button, and then "Connect crypto institution". Following the on-screen instructions, you will be prompted to provide your username and password: your credentials are used - through a 3rd-party provider (Vezgo) - to access and obtain information from your financial institution in order to provide that information to Exirio.

**Exirio never has access to your login credentials**. To find out more about Vezgo security policy, please click [here](https://vezgo.com/security).
