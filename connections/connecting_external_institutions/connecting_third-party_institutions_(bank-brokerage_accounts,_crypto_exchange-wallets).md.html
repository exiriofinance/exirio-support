id="connecting-third-party-institutions-bankbrokerage-accounts-crypto-exchangewallets">Connecting
third-party institutions (bank/brokerage accounts, crypto
exchange/wallets)</h1>
<p>You can connect your bank/broker or crypto exchange/wallet to Exirio
by first selecting the ‘+’ button or the ‘ADD HOLDING’ button, and then
“Connect External Institution”. You can search for your institution in
the search field and, after following the on-screen instructions you
will be prompted to provide your username and password: your credentials
are used - through our 3rd-party partners (<a
href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, <a
href="https://www.flanks.io/">Flanks</a> and <a
href="https://vezgo.com/">Vezgo</a>) - to access and obtain information
from your financial institution in order to provide that information to
Exirio. New institutions are added all the time, so if you cannot find
your institution please send an email to <a
href="mailto:support@exirio.com">support@exirio.com</a> and we will do
our best to have our partners prioritize it in their connection
roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Exirio never has access to your login
credentials</strong>.</p>

<p>Please note that in some cases Exirio may get the wrong
categorization of <a
href="https://support.exirio.com/en/support/solutions/articles/80000369032">Transactions</a>
from your bank/broker (or Plaid/Flanks). In order to calculate the
correct metrics for your investments, you may need to re-categorize some
Transactions manually.</p>
<p>Some financial institutions require specific instructions before a
successful connection can be made, or have specific limitations:</p>
