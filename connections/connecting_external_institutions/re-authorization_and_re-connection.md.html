<h1 id="re-authorization-and-re-connection">Re-authorization and
Re-connection</h1>
<p>Occasionally, connections to financial institutions might be
interrupted for security reasons. Whenever that happens, you will be
notified and asked to reauthorize the connection (through the same
process you followed the first time).</p>
<p>Some financial institutions require reconnections every time that new
data is to be pulled, i.e.Â your information will not get updated every
day, but only when you log in and reauthorize the connection.</p>
<p>If you face any problem with any of your connections, please contact
us at <a href="mailto:support@exirio.com">support@exirio.com</a>.</p>
