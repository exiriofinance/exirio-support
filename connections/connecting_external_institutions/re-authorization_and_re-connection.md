# Re-authorization and Re-connection

Occasionally, connections to financial institutions might be interrupted for security reasons. Whenever that happens, you will be notified and asked to reauthorize the connection (through the same process you followed the first time).

Some financial institutions require reconnections every time that new data is to be pulled, i.e. your information will not get updated every day, but only when you log in and reauthorize the connection.

If you face any problem with any of your connections, please contact us at [support@exirio.com](mailto:support@exirio.com).
