# Connecting third-party institutions (bank/brokerage accounts, crypto exchange/wallets)

You can connect your bank/broker or crypto exchange/wallet to Exirio by first selecting the '+ ' button or the 'ADD HOLDING' button, and then "Connect External Institution". You can search for your institution in the search field and, after following the on-screen instructions you will be prompted to provide your username and password: your credentials are used - through our 3rd-party partners ([Plaid](https://plaid.com/), [Flanks](https://www.flanks.io/) and [Vezgo](https://vezgo.com/)) - to access and obtain information from your financial institution in order to provide that information to Exirio. New institutions are added all the time, so if you cannot find your institution please send an email to [support@exirio.com](mailto:support@exirio.com) and we will do our best to have our partners prioritize it in their connection roadmap.

**Exirio never has access to your login credentials**.

Please note that in some cases Exirio may get the wrong categorization of [Transactions](https://support.exirio.com/en/support/solutions/articles/80000369032) from your bank/broker (or Plaid/Flanks). In order to calculate the correct metrics for your investments, you may need to re-categorize some Transactions manually.

Some financial institutions require specific instructions before a successful connection can be made, or have specific limitations:
