Performance</h1>

<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 200%;">When you click on any
of your individual Holdings, the graph and the metrics that are
displayed are in the
<a href="https://support.exirio.com/en/support/solutions/articles/80000369386">Holding
Currency</a>: if you own a house in the UK for example, you will see by
default the performance in GBP, regardless of your choice for
<a href="https://support.exirio.com/en/support/solutions/articles/80000369318">Owner
Currency</a>, which is used only to show you the current value (which is
also shown in GBP just above the graph). </span>

<p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 200%;">Seeing
Total Gain, MWR and TWR in the Holding Currency allows you to understand
the <em>intrinsic</em> performance of the Investment. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span dir="ltr"
style="line-height: 200%;">If you switch to Owner Currency view, the
return metrics will change (unless Owner and Holding Currency are pegged
one to the other, i.e. their FX rate is roughly constant over time), and
they will include both intrinsic performance and currency
performance. </span></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family: margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="line-height: 200%;">If the
house you bought in the UK a year ago for 100,000 GBP is now worth
110,000 then the MWR is equal to 10%. But if 100,000 GBP were worth
100,000 USD (your Owner Currency) last year and 105,000 USD now, then
the current value of your house is 115,500 USD, implying an MWR of
15.5%. </span></span>

<p style="margin-left: 0in; font-size: 15px; font-family:margin-bottom: 8pt; line-height: 200%; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 200%;">In other words, the
return from the intrinsic performance of the investment has been
positively impacted by an advantageous currency movement. </span>
