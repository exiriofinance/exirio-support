# Currency exposure

The Currency exposure pie chart visualizes:

1. On the Home page, how your Net worth is invested across currencies;
2. When you select any Asset Class in the left menu, how that Asset Class is invested across currencies;
3. When you select in the left menu any Asset Type that includes Positions or Tokens, how that Asset Type is invested across currencies.

Please note that the values used to generate the Currency exposure pie charts are calculated by converting all underlying currencies into your Owner currency, and are net of any corresponding liability.
