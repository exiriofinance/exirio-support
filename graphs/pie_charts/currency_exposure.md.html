<h1 id="currency-exposure">Currency exposure</h1>
<p>The Currency exposure pie chart visualizes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the Home page, how your Net worth is invested across
currencies;</li>
<li>When you select any Asset Class in the left menu, how that Asset
Class is invested across currencies;</li>
<li>When you select in the left menu any Asset Type that includes
Positions or Tokens, how that Asset Type is invested across
currencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that the values used to generate the Currency exposure
pie charts are calculated by converting all underlying currencies into
your Owner currency, and are net of any corresponding liability.</p>
