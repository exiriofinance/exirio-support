# Allocation

The Allocation pie chart visualizes the distribution of your Investments across:

1. Asset Classes, when you are on the Home page;
2. Asset Types that belong to an individual Asset Class, when you select any Asset Class in the left menu;
3. Positions or Tokens, when you select in the left menu any Asset Type that includes Positions or Tokens.

Please note that the values used to generate the Allocation pie charts are calculated by converting all underlying currencies into your Owner currency.
