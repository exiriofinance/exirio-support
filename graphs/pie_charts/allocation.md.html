<h1 id="allocation">Allocation</h1>
<p>The Allocation pie chart visualizes the distribution of your
Investments across:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Asset Classes, when you are on the Home page;</li>
<li>Asset Types that belong to an individual Asset Class, when you
select any Asset Class in the left menu;</li>
<li>Positions or Tokens, when you select in the left menu any Asset Type
that includes Positions or Tokens.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that the values used to generate the Allocation pie
charts are calculated by converting all underlying currencies into your
Owner currency.</p>
