Portfolios, Crypto and Precious Metals are re-priced automatically, as
Exirio will trace the available public prices as of the previous closing
day. Unless the security you have uploaded does not have public prices
providers, you will generally not have to manually update its valuation
- ever.</span>

securities that are traded in smaller exchanges (some bonds, for
example), the public price may be updated much less frequently than
liquid stocks; and you may have a more reliable pricing available (for
example, a live bid from your broker or bank). </span></span>

more correct valuation of your Portfolio, the solution is to classify
that security as a manual one, despite the existence of a public price
source. However, this also means that from that moment on, Exirio will
rely on your valuation updates and will no longer change the price based
on external providers.</span></span>

we can add it right away. </span>
